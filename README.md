## [Project 1 - Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://github.com/mehulg772/Mehul_portfolio/blob/main/Project_Codes/GreenhouseGasEmission.ipynb)
* This project investigates UK government's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to net-zero by 2050. 
* I have written a short summary of my findings and analysis together with visualisations. 


## Scientific Computing

### [Numerical Differentiation](https://github.com/mehulg772/Mehul_portfolio/blob/main/Project_Codes/Numerical-Diff.ipynb)
* We investigate three methods of increasing sophistication to estimate the derivative of a mathematical function. We also look into how to choose the parameters of these methods to get accurate results, testing our algorithm and exploring errors.
